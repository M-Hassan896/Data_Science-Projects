# Emotion Classification in Text Data Using Deep Learning Models

This project involves the development of deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Vanilla RNN) to classify emotions in text data. 

Emotion classification in text data is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP). This project leverages deep learning models to accurately classify emotions in text data. The models implemented are:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
